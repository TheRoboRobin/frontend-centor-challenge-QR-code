## Overview

This was a simple project. Very straight forward but that can be a trap. Not doing the basic workflow things I need because its simple. But that's my goal here. Practice and consistent workflow. Because that's how the knowledge gets solidified.

## My process

I began with a simple html structure with all elements necessary already on the page, defined with bme. I should maybe research other frameworks but that's the one I've learned and its very simple and organized.

After beginning on basic css structuring of the page, I realized the spacing wasn't quite working out how I wanted it to, so I added another container to help with that. Maybe that wasn't the best thing to do but it fixed my issues.

Finally after getting it perfect on desktop I added a simple query to make the mobile version look good.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Block Element Modifier
- Flexbox
- Media Query

### What I learned

Most of what I learned with this project has been related to git and markdown. That's something new to me but I feel like I'm getting a good handle on it.

### Continued development

I want to use css custom properties going forward. I like the variables in sass and this functions the same.

### Useful resources

(https://www.markdownguide.org) was helpful for markdown.
(https://docs.github.com/en) was helpful with troubleshooting git.
